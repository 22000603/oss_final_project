## FindingMe

### What does this project do?
This project implements a site that provides users with specific information according to their MBTI. 

### Why is this project useful?
User can get answers from information shared by people who have the same type of personality. 
The answer is what I like, what actions relieve my stress, what disadvantages I have and how I can overcome.
The site informs users not only when the four types are all the same, but also when the two types are the same, enabling them to find themselves more accurately.
